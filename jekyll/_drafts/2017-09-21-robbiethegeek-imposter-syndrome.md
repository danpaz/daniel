Robbie Holmes ([@robbiethegeek](https://twitter.com/robbiethegeek)) gave a
fantastic talk at TechTalkDC yesterday. Robbie is a fountain of wisdom and the
DC tech community is lucky to have him.

Here are my notes and takeaways:

- Understand your privilege.
- Two big impacts of imposter syndrome:
  - Staying at a job that's boring or tedious way longer than you should
  - Worry people will find out you're a fraud
- Getting acqui-hired is the best way to bring out your imposter syndrome (Zagat to Google)
  - Didn't get interviewed, placed in a "web developer" position
  - Everyone at Google works off of HEAD so you feel like you're constantly breaking things!
  - "It was me saying I didn't have the skills"
- Joining the USDS
  - Folks with a ton of empathy and a lot of experience
  - Healthcare application for Department of Veteran Affairs in node and react
  - React was not core competency
  - Team decided to move over to rails first week in
  - Help
- Community is important
  - Transitioning from being an attendee to organizer - fake it til you make it
  - People start looking up to you
- Staying up to date on trends
  - Podcasts
  - Blogs
  - Social media
  - Know how you learn best
- Learn one new skill at a time
  - Maybe don't switch editors when you're learning a new language
  - Focus on one thing
  - Reduce context switching from what you know to what you're learning
- Imposter syndrome coping strategy
  - Become a part of the community
    - if you're going to tech events, you're probably in the top 25% of people at your level because you're learning from others
    - Speakers are in the top 10%
    - Most people don't engage in community, just because you're here you are ahead of the curve
  - Fake it in public
    - host a lunch and learn
    - present at conferences or meetups
    - become an organizer
